Employee Management System
A Full-Stack MERN Application
Overview
The Employee Management System is a full-stack web application designed to manage employee data. It allows users (e.g., admin or HR personnel) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employees, including adding new employees, viewing employee details, editing employee information, and removing employees from the database.

The application is built using the MERN stack:

MongoDB for database management.
Express as the backend framework.
React for the front-end user interface.
Node.js for the server-side runtime.
Features
Add Employees: Create new employee profiles and store data in the MongoDB database.
View Employees: Display a list of all employees with detailed information.
Update Employee: Edit employee details such as name, department, and contact information.
Delete Employee: Remove employees from the system.
Search Employee: Search functionality to quickly find employees by name or ID.
Technologies Used
Frontend
React: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
Axios: For making HTTP requests from the client to the server.
CSS/Bootstrap: For styling the frontend components.
Backend
Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
Express.js: Web framework for Node.js to handle routes and HTTP requests.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing employee data.
Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library to work with MongoDB.
Nodemon: For automatically restarting the server during development.
Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/md-Gafrujama/employee-management-system.git
cd employee-management-system
Install dependencies for both the backend and frontend:


# For the backend
cd backend
npm install

# For the frontend
cd frontend
npm install
Set up environment variables: In the backend folder, create a .env file and add the following environment variables:


PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongoDB_connection_string
Run the backend server:


cd backend
npm run dev
This will start the Express server with Nodemon for development.

Run the frontend: Open a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend folder, and run the following command:

cd frontend
npm start
Access the application: Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to access the Employee Management System.

API Endpoints
