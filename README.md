Employee Management System
A Full-Stack MERN Application
Overview
The Employee Management System is a full-stack web application designed to manage employee data. It allows users (e.g., admin or HR personnel) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on employees, including adding new employees, viewing employee details, editing employee information, and removing employees from the database.

The application is built using the MERN stack:

MongoDB for database management.
Express as the backend framework.
React for the front-end user interface.
Node.js for the server-side runtime.
Features
Add Employees: Create new employee profiles and store data in the MongoDB database.
View Employees: Display a list of all employees with detailed information.
Update Employee: Edit employee details such as name, department, and contact information.
Delete Employee: Remove employees from the system.
Search Employee: Search functionality to quickly find employees by name or ID.
